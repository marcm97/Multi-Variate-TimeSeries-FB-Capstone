Datasets
There are seven datasets in total.
All transformed using num_filters = 1, stride_len = [3]
1. Basic Motions (load_basic_motions), using 16 features (6*100 -> 16)
2. ArticularyWordRecognition (load_UCR_UEA_dataset), using 40 features (9*144 -> 40)
3. AtrialFibrillation (load_UCR_UEA_dataset), using 40 features (2*640 -> 40)
4. Cricket (load_UCR_UEA_dataset), using 200 features (6*597 -> 200)
5. Epilepsy (load_UCR_UEA_dataset), using 16 features (3*206 -> 16)
6. FingerMovements (load_UCR_UEA_dataset), using 16 features (28*50 -> 16) (NOTE! Gives error if select num_features > 16)
7. Handwriting (load_UCR_UEA_dataset), using 10 features (3*152 -> 10) (NOTE! Performance poor for l2_logistic and svm models)
